[1;33mTesting feature: proxy-option[0m
## Summary

I've completed testing the **proxy-option** feature and documented the results in `/Users/bbloom/Projects/httpie-delta/features/proxy-option.md`.

### Key Findings:

**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Feature deviation identified

**Feature Availability:**
- ✅ **http CLI** (v3.2.4): Fully supports `--proxy PROTOCOL:PROXY_URL` option
- ❌ **spie CLI**: Does NOT support the `--proxy` option

**Details:**
The `--proxy` flag is a significant network feature that allows routing HTTP/HTTPS requests through proxy servers. This is useful for:
- Corporate network environments with proxy requirements
- Security testing and traffic inspection
- Geographic routing and load balancing

The `http` CLI implementation supports:
- Per-protocol proxy configuration (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
- Multiple proxy definitions
- Environment variable support ($HTTP_PROXY, $HTTPS_PROXY, $ALL_PROXY)

**Recommendation:** This is a blocking issue for feature parity. The `--proxy` option should be implemented in spie to match HTTPie's functionality.
