Perfect! I've completed testing the `auth-type-option` feature. Here's a summary:

## Test Summary: auth-type-option

I've thoroughly tested the `--auth-type` option for both `http` and `spie` implementations. Here are the key findings:

### ✅ Supported Features
- **Basic authentication** - Both tools support `--auth-type basic`
- **Bearer authentication** - Both tools support `--auth-type bearer`

### ❌ Deviations Found

1. **Digest Authentication**: 
   - `http` supports it (`--auth-type digest`)
   - `spie` explicitly rejects it with error: "unsupported auth type 'digest'"

2. **Shorthand Flag (`-A`)**:
   - `http` supports the short form (`-A basic`)
   - `spie` does NOT support `-A` and returns: "unknown option '-A'"

### Test Endpoint Results
- Both tools correctly set the `Authorization` header with proper formatting
- Basic auth uses Base64 encoding (e.g., `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz`)
- Bearer auth uses token format (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token123`)

The full test results have been documented in `/Users/bbloom/Projects/httpie-delta/features/auth-type-option.md`.
