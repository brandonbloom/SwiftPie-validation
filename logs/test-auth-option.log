[1;33mTesting feature: auth-option[0m
## Testing Complete

I have completed comprehensive testing of the **auth-option** feature. Here's a summary of the results:

### ✅ Test Results: PASSED

Both `http` and `spie` implementations correctly handle HTTP Basic Authentication through the `--auth` flag.

### Key Findings:

1. **--auth flag**: Works correctly in both implementations
   - `http --auth user:pass` → 200 OK with authenticated response
   - `spie --auth user:pass` → 200 OK with authenticated response

2. **Shorthand (-a)**: Functions identically to the long form
   - Both tools accept `-a` as a short flag

3. **Base64 Encoding**: Verified correct encoding
   - Expected: `dXNlcjpwYXNz` (base64 of `user:pass`)
   - Both tools correctly encode credentials

4. **Authorization Header**: Properly formatted in both implementations
   - Format: `Authorization: Basic <base64>`

5. **Failed Authentication**: Both tools correctly return 401 Unauthorized for wrong credentials

6. **Special Characters**: Handled properly in credential strings

### Documentation Updated:

- ✅ Updated `/features/auth-option.md` with comprehensive test results
- ✅ Updated `/checklist.md` marking auth-option feature as **Passed**

No deviations from expected behavior were detected. The feature is fully compatible between `http` and `spie` implementations.
