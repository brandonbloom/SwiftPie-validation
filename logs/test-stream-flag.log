[1;33mTesting feature: stream-flag[0m
Excellent! I have completed the testing of the **stream-flag** feature. Here's a summary of my findings:

## Test Summary for stream-flag

### Feature: --stream, -S (Stream response body line-by-line)

**Test Status: ❌ FAILED**

### Key Findings:

1. **HTTPie (http) Support**: The `--stream` flag works correctly in HTTPie, enabling line-by-line streaming of response bodies from the `/stream/N` endpoint.

2. **spie Support**: The `--stream` flag is **not implemented** in spie:
   - Using `--stream` returns: `error: unknown option '--stream'` (exit code 64)
   - Using `-S` returns: `error: unknown option '-S'` (exit code 64)
   - The flag is completely absent from spie's help output

3. **Use Cases Affected**:
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
   - Twitter Streaming API compatibility
   - Log streaming and real-time data feeds
   - Any long-lived HTTP connections

### Documentation Created:

1. **features/stream-flag.md** - Comprehensive test documentation showing:
   - Test plan and expected behavior
   - Detailed comparison of http vs spie behavior
   - Evidence of the deviation

2. **issues/stream-flag-not-implemented.md** - Detailed issue report documenting:
   - Current behavior vs expected behavior
   - HTTPie documentation reference
   - Implementation notes for future fixing
   - Use cases affected

3. **checklist.md** - Updated with:
   - Status changed from "Not Tested" to "Failed"
   - References to the feature documentation and issue file

All tasks have been completed and documented.
