## Testing Complete

I have successfully tested the **compress-flag** feature for HTTPie and documented the results.

### Test Summary

**Feature:** `--compress, -x` (Deflate compression with Content-Encoding header)

**Status:** FAILED ❌

**Key Findings:**
1. **http (HTTPie 3.2.4):** ✓ Fully supports `--compress` / `-x` flag
2. **spie (SwiftPie):** ✗ Feature not implemented

### Deviations

The compress-flag is not implemented in spie at all:
- The `--compress` flag is not recognized
- The `-x` short form is not recognized  
- No deflate compression capability exists
- No Content-Encoding header support for compression

### Deliverables

1. **Feature Documentation:** Created `/Users/bbloom/Projects/httpie-delta/features/compress-flag.md` with detailed test results and deviations
2. **Checklist Update:** Updated the central checklist to mark compress-flag as "Failed" with reference to the feature documentation
3. **Test Results:** Verified that http accepts the flag but spie returns "unknown option" error

The feature is not available in spie's simplified Swift-native architecture, which focuses on core HTTP client functionality without request body encoding features.
