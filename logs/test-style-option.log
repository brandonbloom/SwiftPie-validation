Perfect! Let me create a summary of the test completion:

## Test Completion Summary: style-option

I have successfully completed comprehensive testing of the **style-option** feature (`--style, -s`). Here are the key findings:

### Test Results

**Status:** FAILED ✗

The style-option feature is **not implemented in SpIE**, while HTTPie fully supports it.

### Key Findings

**HTTPie Support:**
- Fully implements `--style` / `-s` option
- Supports 40+ color themes (monokai, dracula, solarized-light, nord, vim, github-dark, etc.)
- Special "auto" theme follows terminal ANSI colors
- Proper error handling for invalid styles
- Works with all HTTP methods and request types

**SpIE Support:**
- ✗ No `--style` option support
- ✗ No `-s` short form support
- ✗ Returns "error: unknown option '--style'" when used
- Uses fixed, non-customizable coloring
- Colors auto-disable when output is redirected

### Test Outputs

1. **Features/Tests Created:**
   - `features/style-option.md` - Comprehensive test plan with 10 test cases
   - `issues/25230-style-option.md` - Detailed issue documentation

2. **Checklist Updated:**
   - Updated `checklist.md` to mark style-option as "Failed"
   - Added reference to feature and issue files
