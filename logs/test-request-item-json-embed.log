[1;33mTesting feature: request-item-json-embed[0m
Perfect! I've completed the comprehensive test of the `request-item-json-embed` feature. Here's a summary of my findings:

## Test Summary

**Feature:** request-item-json-embed (`:=@` separator for JSON file embedding)

**Status:** ❌ **FAILED**

### Key Findings:

1. **http (HTTPie)** - ✅ Fully implements the feature:
   - Correctly loads JSON from files using `:=@` syntax
   - Parses the JSON and embeds it in the request body
   - Automatically sets `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Works with simple objects, nested objects, and arrays
   - Properly handles mixed fields (regular fields + JSON embedding)

2. **spie** - ❌ Does not implement the feature:
   - Does not recognize the `:=@` operator for JSON embedding
   - Treats it as a multipart form file field instead
   - Sends requests with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
   - Places file content in the `files` section rather than parsing and embedding JSON

### Tests Performed:
- Simple JSON object embedding from file
- Nested object embedding
- Array embedding
- Mixed fields (combining regular `=` fields with `:=@` JSON embedding)

### Documentation:
Created comprehensive feature test report at `/Users/bbloom/Projects/httpie-delta/features/request-item-json-embed.md` with detailed test results and recommendations for implementation.

Updated the checklist to reflect the failed status and reference the feature documentation.
