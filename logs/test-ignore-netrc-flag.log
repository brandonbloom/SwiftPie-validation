[1;33mTesting feature: ignore-netrc-flag[0m
## Summary

I have completed testing the **ignore-netrc-flag** feature. Here are the findings:

### Test Results: **FAILED** ❌

**Key Finding**: The `--ignore-netrc` flag is implemented in `http` but **missing from `spie`**.

### Details

| Aspect | http | spie |
|--------|------|------|
| Flag present | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Help documentation | Shows: "Ignore credentials from .netrc." | Not documented |
| Functionality | Available | Not implemented |

### What This Means

The `--ignore-netrc` flag is a core HTTPie feature that allows users to explicitly ignore credentials stored in the .netrc file. This is important for:
- Security-conscious users who want to force fresh authentication
- Testing environments where stored credentials would interfere
- Scenarios requiring explicit credential control

Without this flag in spie, there's a **functional gap** in authentication feature parity with http.

### Documentation Created

1. **Feature File**: `features/ignore-netrc-flag.md` - Contains test plan, findings, and status
2. **Issue File**: `issues/25231-ignore-netrc-flag.md` - Documents the deviation with severity assessment (High)

This is a straightforward feature gap that would benefit spie's compatibility with http, especially for users migrating authentication workflows.
