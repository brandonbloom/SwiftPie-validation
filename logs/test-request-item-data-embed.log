[1;33mTesting feature: request-item-data-embed[0m
Excellent! I have completed testing the `request-item-data-embed` feature. Here's a summary of my findings:

## Testing Summary: request-item-data-embed Feature

### Feature Overview
The `request-item-data-embed` (=@) feature allows users to read file contents and embed them as field values in requests.

### Key Findings: FAILED ✗

I identified **critical incompatibilities** between the http and spie implementations:

1. **Content Type Mismatch**:
   - `http`: Embeds files as JSON string values (application/json)
   - `spie`: Treats all `=@` as multipart file uploads (multipart/form-data)

2. **Missing --form Flag Support**:
   - spie doesn't recognize the `--form` flag at all
   - No way to explicitly control encoding

3. **Semantic Misinterpretation**:
   - `http`: `=@` means "read file content as string field value"
   - `spie`: `=@` means "upload file as multipart" (wrong interpretation)

4. **Field Name Corruption**:
   - spie appends `=` to field names: `"file="` instead of `"file"`

### Test Cases Executed

✗ **Test 1**: Single data-embed field - INCOMPATIBLE
✗ **Test 2**: JSON file embedding - INCOMPATIBLE
✗ **Test 3**: Multiple data-embed fields - INCOMPATIBLE
⚠ **Test 4**: With --form flag - BLOCKER (unsupported)
✗ **Test 5**: Mixed regular and embedded fields - INCOMPATIBLE

### Impact
Applications expecting JSON payloads with embedded file content will receive multipart form uploads instead, causing failures for REST APIs and scripts expecting JSON format.

The comprehensive test report has been saved to `/Users/bbloom/Projects/httpie-delta/features/request-item-data-embed.md` with detailed analysis of each test case and recommendations for fixing the implementation.
