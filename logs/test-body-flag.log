Perfect! Let me create a summary:

## Test Summary: body-flag

I have successfully tested the `--body, -b` feature for HTTPie and completed the following:

### Test Results

**Feature:** `--body, -b` - Print only response body (shortcut for `--print=b`)

**Test Status:** ❌ **FAILED**

### Key Findings

1. **http (reference implementation):**
   - Supports `--body` and `-b` flags
   - Prints only the response body when used
   - Headers and metadata are suppressed

2. **spie (implementation under test):**
   - Does NOT implement `--body` flag
   - Does NOT implement `--print` option (which is the equivalent functionality)
   - Always prints both headers and body (no way to suppress headers)

### Deviation

This is a **feature gap** in spie. The `--body` flag and the underlying `--print` option for output control are not implemented. This affects users who want to:
- Print only response bodies
- Process JSON responses without header noise
- Create output-only pipelines

### Documentation Generated

1. **features/body-flag.md** - Comprehensive test report with:
   - Feature description
   - Detailed test results for both implementations
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Deviation analysis
   - Related feature references

2. **checklist.md** - Updated test status for body-flag from "Not Tested" to "Failed" with reference to the feature documentation

All tasks have been completed and tracked in the todo list.
